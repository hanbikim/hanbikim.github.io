# IEEE Conference Template Summary

EASE OF USE: Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications
             기존 명세된 규칙을 따라야한다. 마음대로 포맷 변경하지 말기
        
A. Abbreviations and Acronyms:   
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text  
Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable
축약어를 처음으로 사용할 때, 정의하기.
불가피한 상황 이외에는 제목이나 헤드에 축약어를 적지 말기.



B.  Units
Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units
SI (MKS) 또는 CGS 단위 사용하기.


E. Some Common Mistakes
* data; plural, not singular
* quotation marks("") are used to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. 
* 
* A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
* essentially X, “approxi-mately” or “effectively”.

* that uses -> using, capitalize "u"

Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones
“affect” and “effect”, “complement” and “compliment”,
“discreet” and “discrete”, “principal” and “principle”.
• Do not confuse “imply” and “infer”.
• The prefix “non” is not a word; it should be joined to the
word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
• There is no period after the “et” in the Latin abbreviation
“et al.”.
• The abbreviation “i.e.” means “that is”, and the abbrevi-
ation “e.g.” means “for example”.
